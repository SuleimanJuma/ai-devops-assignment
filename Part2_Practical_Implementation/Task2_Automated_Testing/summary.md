## Task 2: Automated Testing with Selenium  

We used **Python** and **Selenium WebDriver** with **ChromeDriver** to automate testing of valid and invalid login scenarios on a practice login page.  

### Implementation Details  
- Selenium controlled the browser, entered credentials, and submitted the form.  
- Verified the appearance of appropriate **success** and **error messages** based on input validity.  

### Key Benefits  
✅ **Eliminates repetitive manual testing** – Reduces human effort in regression testing.  
✅ **Enables consistent, fast checks** – Ensures reliable validation across test cycles.  
✅ **Improves test coverage in CI/CD pipelines** – Supports DevOps practices with automated regression testing.  

### Results  
- Screenshot [`result_screenshot.png`] captures successful test execution.  
- Both **valid** and **invalid** login scenarios passed, confirming test reliability.
