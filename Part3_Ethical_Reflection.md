# Part 3: Ethical Reflection

## Potential Biases in the Dataset

While using the breast cancer dataset for predictive analytics, potential biases include:

- **Underrepresented Groups:** Certain races or age groups may be underrepresented, leading to a model that performs poorly on these groups.
- **Label Imbalance:** The dataset shows a class imbalance (majority 'Alive', minority 'Dead'), which may cause the model to favor the majority class and underpredict critical high-priority cases.
- **Feature Collection Bias:** Some features may reflect societal or systemic biases, such as differences in healthcare access or treatment quality, which may skew predictions unfairly.

These biases can lead to **unfair resource allocation**, misclassification of high-priority cases, and potential negative impacts on underrepresented patients if deployed in a real clinical setting.

## Mitigating Bias Using IBM AI Fairness 360

**IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)** is a library designed to detect and mitigate bias in datasets and models. It can be used in this project by:

1. **Bias Detection:**
   - Measure fairness metrics like disparate impact, equal opportunity, and statistical parity.
   - Identify specific features or groups where bias is present before deploying the model.

2. **Bias Mitigation:**
   - Apply preprocessing techniques (e.g., reweighting, re-sampling) to reduce dataset bias.
   - Use in-processing or post-processing methods to adjust model predictions to achieve fairer outcomes.
   - Continuously monitor model predictions for fairness over time.

By using AIF360, we can align the model with **ethical AI standards**, ensuring fairer predictions while preserving predictive accuracy, and fostering trust in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

## Conclusion

Using predictive models in healthcare requires a commitment to fairness and transparency to avoid unintended harm. By understanding dataset biases and applying tools like IBM AI Fairness 360, we can improve the ethical deployment of AI in practical scenarios.
